<h3> Moses A. West</h3>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JRetsj0vE"> Moses A. West is an A.I. Hero who makes water out of our atmosphere in other words out of Air. He created a device that pulls moisture out of the air the same way you take a cold bottle of coke in the middle of the summer and it continues to sweat.This is a huge resource when you have disaster areas like Flint, Michigan for example. It creates a source of free water and you don't have to have FEMA transport water into disaster areas.
