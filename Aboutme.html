<p>Hello, I'm a Wrestling and boxing coach, I enjoy long walks and biking in my free time. I'm also a big lover of dogs. I grew up with dogs in the home so I have two of my own. I enjoy walking them and playing fetch with them. Some might not enjoy it but I also do enjoy feeding my pups. They get home cooked meals and at times I wonder if they eat better than myself haha!</p>
